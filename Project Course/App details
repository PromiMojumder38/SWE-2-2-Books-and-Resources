App Name:  Rent IT / Recycle Bin ðŸ™„

Main Idea:

It is an android app that creates an online based renting, buying and selling platform where one type of users can rent or sell their products or give away their products for free and another type of users will take those products on rent in exchange for money or free of cost based on condition.

Details:

1. Free exchange: Suppose you have a product that you don't need anymore. Almost a waste for you. But at the same time, it may be very needed for another person. So instead of wasting it, you can give it for free to the people who need it through this app. This whole process is free of cost.

2. Rent or sell in exchange for money:
Suppose you have a product (like clothes, watches, furniture etc) that you don't use very often. Then you can rent this product for a time duration (like 7 days, 15 days etc) in exchange for money.

After using the product if any user likes it, there is an option where he can request the owner for the permanent sale of that product.

The Ideology of the App:

Things that are considered unusable / less usable for some people can come in handy for others. Our goal is to recycle those things through this app which would otherwise be thrown away.
